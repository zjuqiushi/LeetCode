Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

For base b (decimal case b = 10), the digit root of an integer is:

dr(n) = 0 if n == 0
dr(n) = (b-1) if n != 0 and n % (b-1) == 0
dr(n) = n mod (b-1) if n % (b-1) != 0
or

dr(n) = 1 + (n - 1) % 9
Note here, when n = 0, since (n - 1) % 9 = -1, the return value is zero (correct).

class Solution {
public:
    int addDigits(int num) {
        return 1 + (num - 1) % 9;
    }
};
