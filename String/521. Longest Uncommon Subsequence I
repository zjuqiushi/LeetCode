Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this group of two strings. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: "aba", "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" (or "cdc"), 
because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba", 
but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings. 
Note:

1. Both strings' lengths will not exceed 100.
2. Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.

题意：找最大不相同子序列

思路：一开始理解成以b为基准，a的子串不能出现b的任意一个字符，求最大长度；因为任意一个字符串是自身的子串，所以只要先比较两者是否相等，若相等，返回-1；
若不相等，返回两者中较长的长度

Me：
class Solution {
public:
    int findLUSlength(string a, string b) {
        // bool flag[256] = {false};
        // if(a == b || a == "")
        //     return -1;
        // for(int i=0;i<b.size();i++)
        //     flag[b[i]] = true;
        // int cnt = 0;
        // for(int i=0;i<a.size();i++)
        // {
        //     if(!flag[a[i]])
        //         cnt++;
        // }
        // if(cnt == 0)
        //     return -1;
        // else
        //     return cnt;
        if(a == b)
            return -1;
        else
            return max(a.size(), b.size());
    }
}; 

class Solution {
public:
    int findLUSlength(string a, string b) {
        return a == b ? -1 : (a.size() > b.size() ? a.size() : b.size());
    }
};
