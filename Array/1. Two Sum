Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]

题意：求出一个数组中a+b=target的下标

思路：map<int, int>记录数字位置

vector<int> twoSum(vector<int> &numbers, int target)
{
    //Key is the number and value is its index in the vector.
	unordered_map<int, int> hash;
	vector<int> result;
	for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
		int numberToFind = target - numbers[i];

            //if numberToFind is found in map, return them
		if (hash.find(numberToFind) != hash.end()) {
                    //+1 because indices are NOT zero based
			result.push_back(hash[numberToFind] + 1);
			result.push_back(i + 1);			
			return result;
		}

            //number was not found. Put it in the map.
		hash[numbers[i]] = i;
	}
	return result;
}
