You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

题意：和一个朋友玩游戏取石头的游戏，每次能取走1-3块（你先开始拿），给定石头个数n，确定你是否能赢下游戏

思路：根据题意，若剩下4块石头，则必输，否则赢，则根据剩余石头是否是4的倍数来确定输赢

class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        return (n % 4 !=0);
    }
};
